I've never tried Boba Tea

It's the one with the edible bubbles, right?

Apparently there are a tonne of different flavours from like, normal tea to fruity things.
I've tried apricot-flavoured ice tea and a cold Hot Chocolate. (I wouldn't recommend that one.)
But it's not the same as boba tea apparently.

Idek where I could buy some from - I'll have to do some research in my area.

Maybe I could make my own? I like making my own things like smoothies and hot sauce.

Mmmm... No Mag, don't make chilli-flavoured boba tea.
