An interesting language feature

Original: (Destructuring in JavaScript) 
  let [x, y] = [3, 4]
  // x is 3, and y is 4
Alright seems good, very helpful.

Idea:
  let x + 1 = 3
  // x is 2
  let y - x = 2
  // y is 4, as x is defined
Sure, I mean - why not? 

Problems:
Consider this
  let x*x - 1 = 0
Hm...
What would x be? The square root of 1?...
But that is both 1 and -1...

Could it be a list containing both?

In maths, it'd be Â±1.
How would that work in programming?
